    <FONT face="Courier New" color=black size=7><b>Introduction</B></FONT><BR><br>

		<FONT face="Courier New" COLOR=black  size=5>

    <FONT face="Courier New" color=black size=7><b>My Background</B></FONT><BR><br>
    <FONT face="Courier New" color=black size=5><b>Education</B></FONT><BR><br>

		<FONT face="Courier New" COLOR=black  size=5>
			My major was mathematics and studied the computer programming in early 
			‘80s as my sub-major and in those days the main frame computer like IBM 
			were more common and the personal computers yet started in Asian schools. </FONT><BR><br><br>

     <FONT face="Courier New" color=black size=5><b>Information Technology</B></FONT><BR><br>

		<FONT face="Courier New" COLOR=black  size=5>
			First IT job started at the IBM main frame in the heavy machine/plant manufacturing company 
			and I was in charge of mathematical simulation models for the engineering 
			optimising through the computer programming. (This job was most exciting to me!).<br><br>
	    After I immigrated to Australia, I have worked at e-commerce  industry.<br><br>
			As time passes, the IT industry has been expanded rapidly from the main-frame to PC, 
			mobile phone, internet, SNS, Virtual gaming world…etc 
			and I need to upgrade my IT skill to adapt these new world. 
			That is why I decided to study RMIT Information technology.

     <FONT face="Courier New" color=black size=5><b>Philosophy/Hobby</B></FONT><BR><br>
	    <FONT face="Courier New" COLOR=black  size=5>
			I have never studied philosophy but my favourite philosopher is Ayn Rand. 
		        I am often listening the YouTube clips about her philosophy and it made me free and more energetic with my life. <br><br>
			No special hobby but simply walking a lot is my most relaxed time and I also like watching LOL(league of legend game) 
		        and listening the YouTube clips about politics/economics.  
		        It helps me to think which future IT business wll be to come.

	    	<FONT face="Courier New" color=black size=7><b>Project Idea</B></FONT><BR><br>
	    
	    <FONT face="Courier New" COLOR=black  size=5>
			overview:<br>
			The project idea is developing the peer to peer trade/loan system based on blockchain technology. 
		    This is relatively new business model and getting more competitive and more people already started into this business.<br><br>
		   
		    Motivation:<br> With my e-commerce experience, all the middle system like credit card, 
		    ebay, alibaba, bank and paypal ..etc has charged very high fees(10 to 30% altogether) as well as GST per sale 
		    and it makes the retail sellers or the end seller very hard to make a profit. 
		    It can lower the trading fee significantly and it also make more people to be involved on business as anyone 
		    can trade items from hand-made items to factory item to the buyer directly with more reasonable price. 
		    It is also possible for anyone to lend/borrow money without any interference of financial institution 
		    like bank/financial loan company and borrowers/lenders can find best deals easily and the risk can be distributed.<br><br>
		    
		    Tools and technologies:<br> 
			To develop this system, finding the proper blockchain platform is essential as it will cost less and to develop 
		    this app, c# (or java) HTML, CSS and java script are also necessary. As a beginner of IT student. 
		    I am not sure what more tools and technologies are necessary. <br><br>
		    
		    Skills Required:<br>
			To develop the system, the professional skills to understand the algorithm of blockchain are essential.
		    The social media experts for sales, graphic designer, skilled programmers are also essential.<br><br>
		    
		    Outcome:<br>
			More people can sell products/property/buildings/service direct to the consumers without any intervention of bank, 
		    middlemen or financial institution and both parties can save money. Some investor can buy just a faction of an investment 
		    property with small money and do not have to worry about co-ownership of the property as each investor trade the fraction independently.  
		    Also, home buyers/borrowers can get mortgage/loan directly from lenders worldwide.
