    <FONT face="Courier New" color=black size=5><b>Education</B></FONT><BR><br>

		<FONT face="Courier New" COLOR=black  size=5>
			My major was mathematics and studied the computer programming in early 
			‘80s as my sub-major and in those days the main frame computer like IBM 
			were more common and the personal computers yet started in Asian schools. </FONT><BR><br><br>

		<FONT face="Courier New" COLOR=black  size=5>
			First IT job started at the IBM main frame in the heavy machine/plant manufacturing company 
			and I was in charge of mathematical simulation models for the engineering 
			optimising through the computer programming. (This job was most exciting to me!).<br><br>
	    After I immigrated to Australia, I have worked at e-commerce  industry.<br><br>
			As time passes, the IT industry has been expanded rapidly from the main-frame to PC, 
			mobile phone, internet, SNS, Virtual gaming world…etc 
			and I need to upgrade my IT skill to adapt these new world. 
			That is why I decided to study RMIT Information technology.

     <FONT face="Courier New" color=black size=5><b>Philosophy/Hobby</B></FONT><BR><br>
	    <FONT face="Courier New" COLOR=black  size=5>
			I have never studied philosophy but my favourite philosopher is Ayn Rand. 
		        I am often listening the YouTube clips about her philosophy and it made me free and more energetic with my life. <br><br>
			No special hobby but simply walking a lot is my most relaxed time and I also like watching LOL(league of legend game) 
		        and listening the YouTube clips about politics/economics.  
		        It helps me to think which future IT business wll be to come.
